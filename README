The goal of this collection of scripts is to aid iNaturalist 
users that are joining eBird to migrate their previous records

eBird enables batch upload of historical observations, and tutorials are available. We will follow this one:

* https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000907878-upload-spreadsheet-data-to-ebird


Data must be imported as a .csv file, so that is what we generate.


The tutorial says: "There are three key requirements for every eBird checklist. Every eBird list must:

* Correspond to a single calendar date (i.e., no checklists spanning multiple days)

* Correspond to a single map location (i.e., no checklists combining birds from separate sites)

* Include an observation type or "protocol" that describes how you went birding; if you are not sure which protocol to use, see our [Guide to eBird Protocols](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859)."


iNaturalist has calendar dates and coordinates for observations, so that is kind of covered. In our case, the protocol will be "[Historical](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859#anchorHistorical)"

We will be using the "eBird Record Format": 

"The eBird Record Format is designed to capture large tables of observations. Each row in the spreadsheet represents a complete species observation. You can upload as many checklists as you want in a single Record Format spreadsheet, up to 1 MB file size."
